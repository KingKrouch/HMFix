TODO:
- Fix the blurred dialogue segments appearing stretched with the current display aspect ratio
- Fix the internal resolution of the dialogue segments.
- Expose the MSAA, supersampling, anisotropic filtering, and Post-Process Anti-Aliasing settings for the user to modify.
- Possibly expose the other menus and things to keyboard and mouse inputs (I imagine they're storing this information somewhere within some Unity NewInput binding assets or something).
- Fix the atrocious mouse control for the camera.

Too early to say whether or not adding KB/M prompts will be possible.
